# Uber-Analysis-Project
This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data analytics positions at Uber.

Uber-Analysis-Project includes 2 parts:
## Part 1: Insights from City Supply and Demand Data
In this section, we use the data provided to answer questions to provide insights into customer needs and Uber's service capabilities.

Q1. Name the 72 hours with the highest amount of zeroes.

Q2. Between the 1st and 5th of February, which dates have the most completed trips?

Q3. What hour of the day had the most completed trips on February 11? 

Q4. What hour of the day from the 15 days in February had the last number of requests?

Q5. What is the percentage of all the eyeballs that occurred on Friday?

Q6. What is the weighted average of requests per driver for the 15-day data set?

Q7. Driver's schedules are drafted in 4-hour shifts, and Uber wants to change this to 8-hour shifts. Calculate which shift has the highest requests for the 15 day data set.

Q8. When the number of unique drivers increases so does the number of eyeballs?

Q9. On which day of the ratio the highest for the number of completed trips to requests?

Q10. If you have 10 drivers to add to one hour throughout the 15 data set, which hour would you add them to?

Q11. How many hours of data are in this data set?

Q12. Use the data to determine when the best end-of-day is for drivers.

Q13. Which was the busiest 4-hour period in the data?

## Part 2: Partner Business Modeling
In this section, we use the provided data to answer the questions in the two cases to determine the business partner model.

*Scenario 1*: The 4th of July is coming up and the maximum fleet is needed. To get drivers to go online, we're assessing the following two bonus options in terms of cost:

- Promotion 1: $100 bonus to each driver who is online for at least 5 hours, accepts more than 78% of requests, completes 15 trips and has a 4 or 5 rating at this time.

- Promotion 2: A $5 bonus per trip to each driver that completes at least 15 trips and has a rating at least 4.

Q1. How much will drivers be paid with Promotion 1?

Q2. How much will drivers be paid with Promotion 2?

Q3. How many drivers would qualify for a bonus under Promotion 1 but not under Promotion 2?

Q4. Uber wants to give out awards to its drivers. Award criteria: Complete more than 23 trips in an 8-hour shift with an 80% acceptance rate and a rating of 4 or 5. Please determine which drivers will be given awards.

*Scenario 2*: A taxi driver currently generates $300 per day in fares (before expenses), works five days a week, takes two weeks off, and has the following expenses:

- Gas is $100 per week
- Insurance is $400 per month
- Prius lease is $300 per week (Vehicle rent)

The driver doesn't pay gas and rent expenses on off weeks.

A driver wants to upgrade from X to a Black driver. The driver needs to purchase a new vehicle. They want to upgrade to a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. Assuming the Hyundai Sonata costs $49500.

Q1. Calculate the net income for a driver in a year

Q2. How much would the driver's gross fares need to increase per week to fully pay for the car in year 1 and maintain the same yearly profit margin as before?
